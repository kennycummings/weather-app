5-Day Forecast: Displays a 5-day forecast with the same details as current weather for each day.

Search History and Local Storage: Keeps track of the user's search history and provides a clickable list of past cities that instantly updates the page.

## Functionality

To use, enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Search" button to display the current weather and 5-day forecast on the page.

Previously searched cities are listed in a history. Clicking on a city in the history will display its weather information.
